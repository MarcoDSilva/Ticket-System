# Ticket-System

The end goal was to complete a MVP within 5 weeks, from the conception 'til the best possible in the timeframe.

This app was made with .net with the language vb.net following the MVC pattern, razor (html), css and boostrap. The backend db was with SQL (sql server).
It has a basic dashboard for admin / users, CRUD operations for every user that has permission, and permissions to access X pages depending on the level of the user.
